# kaggle_ubc_ocean

I participated in Kaggle's UBC-OCEAN competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/UBC-OCEAN/overview).
The result was 91/1327th place on the public leaderboard, which was within the bronze medal range, but due to a big shakedown, I was placed 276/1327th on the private leaderboard.
Post the code for the competition at that time
